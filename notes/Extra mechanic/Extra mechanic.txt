Idea for the lower-left square in menu:

1/ Heartbeat mechanic:
The square will display the line of heartbeat (like in hospital)
Heartbeat will increase if:
-Lower health
-Ran alot (low stamina)
-Saw certain type of enemy

Increase heartbeat will affect:
-Faster movement speed
-Protagonist has higher resistant to pain
-Less sneaky because of heartbeat sound and breath


2/ 6th Sense mechanic
The box is like a type of radar, detect enemy when near player and warn player
Suitable with hard-to-see enemy or very-fast enemy
Like the scanner in Alien: Isolation


3/ Just a minimap
Easier to navigate, collect notes / explore will reveal the minimap

[Draft 1]
	MC is a man who spent his life play Leng Ming and Doto in his free time and research weird thing
during his "work time". Unbelievably, he is quite smart, and his first successful subject allow 
him to create enough amount of food, water and energy for him to use as much as he please. Thus,
he never set a food outside his mansion (which is somewhere in a big forest)

	He, when near the end of his life, regret that he didn't play more single player games, and doing
extrovert-ish thing like go tourism or date a girl, so he researched a way to restore his youth. 
And he found! However, he need a replacement, another human, (preferably someone who look similar to him
when he young) required. The process will swap each other's body. Now the Antagonist in MC body will chase 
him down to get back his body. Or sth like that.

	Maybe the MC drink some mutated potion to gain Intelligence and Strength in order to live longer can
can reseach better. Thus, make him have a disgusting appearance, an horror abomination, a hideous monster.
